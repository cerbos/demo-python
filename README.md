# Cerbos Python Demo

Run the following command to try out the demo:

```shell
./pw demo
```

The demo script (`main.py`) starts a new Cerbos container with the policies from the `policies` directory and sends requests for a set of different principals and resources to demonstrate how policy evaluation works.

Try deleting the `condition` block attached to the `direct_manager` derived role (line 23--28 in `policies/derived_roles_1.yml`) and running `./pw demo` again. Amanda, who was previously disallowed from viewing or approving Harryâ€™s leave requests should now be allowed to do those actions.
